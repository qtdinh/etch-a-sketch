# etch-a-sketch

## About
A project from The Odin Project, where the aim was to create a 16x16 square div sketchpad.

Capabilities include:
1. A hover effect over the square that changes color.
2. The existing grid container does not change its dimensions, should the user want to change the number of squares with the button above.
3. The limit of user input is a maximum of 100 to prevent any crashes.

Will be included (extra credit):
1. Completely random RGB value each hover.

## What I learned
1. Adding the same class to each div.
2. Knowing how to implement addEventListener to each element with the same class.
3. Usage of grid display.
4. Mouseover events.
